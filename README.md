## 📖 Overview / 项目简介
**3CD-MD** is a multi-dimensional Chinese cyberbullying dataset designed to facilitate research on **implicit violence detection** and **psychological mechanism analysis**. 

It addresses two critical challenges in current research:
1.  **Context Detachment:** By providing event backgrounds (Scene), it prevents models from learning spurious correlations.
2.  **Lack of Attribution:** By annotating **Cognitive Distortions** (Subject), it helps models identify "rational camouflage" and implicit aggression.
